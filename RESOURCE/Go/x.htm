### Intrapersonal Barriers:
Intrapersonal barriers are obstacles that arise within an individual's own mind. They include:

**Remedies**:
- **Effective Communication Policies**: Implement clear communication policies and procedures to streamline communication channels and reduce ambiguity.  - **Promote Open-door Policies**: Encourage open-door policies to foster a culture of transparency and approachability among leaders and employees.  - **Cultural Sensitivity Training**: Provide cultural sensitivity training to help employees understand and respect diverse perspectives and communication styles.  - **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish feedback mechanisms to solicit input from employees and address communication issues proactively.
